# Community Tracker Mod for Powerpipe

A collection of benchmarks, controls, and dashboards used to track organization settings, repository settings, open issues and pull requests, and more.

## Overview

Dashboards and benchmarks can help answer questions like:

- How old are my issues and pull requests?
- What's my age trend data?
- Which organizations and repositories aren't configured correctly?

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [Github plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install github
```

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-community-tracker
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.

### Running Checks in Your Terminal

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `powerpipe benchmark` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run community_tracker.steampipe_plugin_repository_checks
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://powerpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/benchmark#output-formats).
